# Goldman_Sachs_Virtual_Program

In this program, we were given a data set of hashes and we determined the following:
What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?
What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?
What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?
What can you tell about the organizationâ€™s password policy (e.g. password length, keyspace, etc.)?
What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder? 

In the end, we wrote an e-mail to the evaluator describing our developments.
